Hey. I'm Venom, Halt, or Fleshy. You can refer to me as any of these.

I go by it/they.

I no longer accept friend requests unless we've hung out more than once.

I am deeply sorry if I unfriend you. It's because we barely talk. No hate against anyone.

Yes, I still do accept C+H.

I'm not sure what else to put here.
